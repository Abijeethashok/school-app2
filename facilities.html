    <div class = "body3">
    <h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
    <P>We pay close attention to the travel safety of our students. With a fleet of buses with 40 seats each, we ensure every student gets comfortable seating during their journey. Our buses meet all the required government regulation standards and have well-trained drivers who take care of pick-ups and drops on the assigned routes. We also have bus attenders who look after the students and take care of seating arrangements.</P>
</div>

    <div class = "body4">
    <h3>LIBRARY</h3>
    <p>Reading is to the mind, what exercise is to the body. Our libraries house an expansive collection of books that suit the reading levels of different age groups.

        The in-house library also subscribes to leading national dailies and journals. We also have an audio and video collection that can be used to augment classroom learning</p>
    </div>

        <div class = "body5">
    <h3>SPORTS</h3>
    <P>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. At all our institutions, we encourage a healthy balance of work and play. Students are encouraged to experience the challenge and reward of sports through diverse programmes at the school level.

       Our sports department is managed by qualified and competent instructors who design a sports curriculum that improves mental strength, concentration, physical conditioning and coordination, strategic and tactical planning and of course, teamwork.
        
       We conduct an annual inter-branch sports meet, along with a variety of other activities like athletics, team games, and indoor games.</P>
       </div>

       <div class = "body6">
    <h3>LABS</h3>
    <p>Our well-equipped labs are a testament to our belief in learning by doing. From practical experiments to other activities, these labs promote an activity-based approach to make learning more stimulating.</p>
 </div>

    <div class = "body7">
    <h3>HOSTEL</h3>
    <p>Our hostels are equipped with all the amenities necessary to offer students a comfortable and disciplined living and learning environment. From top-notch accommodation to experienced doctors, we prioritise every aspect that aids the kids in their holistic development journey.</p>
 </div>

    <div class = "body8">
    <h3>DIGITAL LABS</h3>
    <P>In a new era of world-class education, We adopted a technology-driven approach to studies. The schools have replaced textbooks with trendy tabs for students from class five to seven. This learning technique not only makes children adept in the use of technology but also reduce the load of study materials to be carried every day.</P>
  </div>

    <div class = "body9">
    <h3>FUN CLUB</h3>
    <P>We believe in a stress-free learning environment. To that end, our curriculum is specifically designed to lift the burden off studentsâ€™ shoulders, ensuring that learning is an interactive, engaging process. Special emphasis is put on effective and enjoyable methods of education (our digital learning initiatives are one such example) so that students become knowledgeable, inquisitive global learners.</P>
